" Remapping the basic movement keys to Dvorak's right 'home' position
" We don't need to remap the h key
" noremap h h
noremap t j
noremap n k
noremap s l

" Remapping the semicolon=colon to avoid pressing shift
noremap ; :

" Remapping q: to q; because the list of last commands is very useful
noremap q; q:

" Useful remaps to navigate to the beginning and the end of the line
noremap - $
noremap _ ^
noremap <leader>- 078lb

" Since we are going to use the 'n' key to navigate, we need another key
" for the search results.
" Let's take the chance and append 'zz' to the command, so the search result
" will be centralized on the window.
noremap k nzz
noremap K Nzz

" This mapping is the Dvorak version of the famous jj jk mappings
" which saves a lot of visits to the Esc key to return to normal mode
" Here I opt for three keystrokes because tt and nn are normal in written
" language
inoremap ttt <Esc>jj
inoremap nnn <Esc>kk
